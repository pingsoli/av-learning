#### Some noise when playing audio at middle ?
at beginning, Audio AVPacket Queue will be full, then starts to decrease, at last, wait a long time
to get a audio AVPacket, because current thread is stucked at `videoPktQueue.Push(tmpPkt)`.

at last, I found the problem
```
if (pkt.stream_index == mediaInfo.VideoStreamIndex()) {
  videoPktQueue.Push(tmpPkt);
} else if (pkt.stream_index == mediaInfo.AudioStreamIndex()) {
  audioPktQueue.Push(tmpPkt);
}

    / -------> Video AVPacket Queue --------> Video AVFrame Queue --------> Screen
   /  
File   demux                         decode                        render
   \
    \ -------> Audio AVPacket Queue --------> Audio AVFrame Queue --------> Speaker
```

rendering process is too slow, and Video AVFrame Queue is full, and Video AVPacket Queue is full too, and could't be pushed
more data, and demux thread must wait until Video AVPacket Queue is not full(decoded by video decoding thread), and Audio AVPacket
Queue is consumed too fast(decoded -> playing through speaker) and has no enough data. so there is reason for noise at the middle of
playing audio.
