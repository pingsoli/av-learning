**the outline of pipeline processing**
```
Vertex Data[] -> Vertex Shader -> Shape Assembly -> Geometry Shader ---+
                                                                       |
             Tests and Blending <- Fragment Shader <- Rasterization <--+

Basically, we can only control Vertex Data, Vertex Shader, Geometry Shader and Fragment Shader.
```

#### Shader
**What is shader ?**  
Shader is little program rests on CPU can be executed parallelly.
Shaders are written in C-like language GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language).
there are various types of shader, such as vertex shader and fragment shader.

**GLSL**  
GLSL full name is OpenGL Shading Language. It's kind of C-like language.

**GLSL ES and GLSL**  
GLSL ES(for Embeded Systems) is variant of GLSL of Desktop.

#### GLFW and GLAD
to intall GLFW and GALD on windows, you can refer to this [link](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started).  
GLFW is a library for OpenGL.  
GLAD is extension for using OpenGL correctly.  
**NOTE: don't delete the `glad.c` file in the project.**

#### stab library for graphics and audio
git repo: https://github.com/nothings/stb.git  
this library used in OpenGL texture examples, it helped to load a *.png file to raw char data.

stab is header-only library.

---
#### GLM library for OpenGL Mathematics
git repo: https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git  
It's a header-only library.
